## My process

Started out with the html markups for the structure then proceeded to the styling using css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved my skills on flexbox with this project. I also explored CSS grids while doing this task even though I didn't particularly use it. Also learnt some new css tricks while styling.


### Continued development

CSS Grid will be an area I'll explore on subsequent projects so as to develop my skills in that aspect.
